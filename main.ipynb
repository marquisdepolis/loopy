      "Please note: If you are not an expert researcher, the general discussion below will help you understand some of the questions involved with selecting sources. But what qualifies as evidence or as a reliable source is different in different disciplines, and sometimes among different courses in the same discipline. It’s very important to check with your teachers about appropriate sources for the research you’ve been assigned.\n",
      "Scholarly sources are those that have been approved by a group with recognized expertise in the field under discussion. Books published by University Presses fall into this category, as do articles published in peer-reviewed journals—journals where the editors send pieces out to be read by experts in the field before deciding to publish them. The Yale library subscribes to several databases that specialize in scholarly sources (such as Academic Search Premier). See Databases for more information. If you use sources for facts or ideas in your writing, some research projects will demand that you rely heavily if not exclusively on scholarly sources. Scholarly sources are not infallible, but their publication process includes many steps for verifying facts, for reducing political bias, and for identifying conflicts of interest (for instance, for informing readers when a drug company has funded research on its own product).\n",
      "In a narrow sense, every other source could be called a popular source. But this does not mean that all popular sources are of equal reliability. Nor does it mean that you should use only scholarly sources for all of your writing at Yale. Depending on the research context, some projects will permit a mix of scholarly and popular sources. As a general rule, the more specialized the course or the research project you’re working on, the more you should restrict yourself to using verified, expert sources in your paper. In a history seminar about World War II, you would usually be expected to consult the most definitive, academic studies of the period. But in a literary essay analyzing Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, you may be able to rely on a popular history for facts about World War II, because the focus of your paper is on interpreting the novel. This is not to say you can rely on what your friends say about the war or on the “facts” in Saving Private Ryan. But a trade paperback issued by a major publisher may be sufficient.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to the analysis, R excels in statistical analysis and data visualization, making it popular in finance and academia. Python is ideal for data analysis due to its wide range of open-source tools for visualization and machine learning, particularly for reading and writing data. Rust is a growing language that is becoming more popular for data analysis.\n",

      "However, the discussion acknowledges that a more thorough analysis is necessary for comprehensive conclusions. For instance, it could consider more detailed information about the specific analyses and tasks in which each language excels, as well as any limitations or drawbacks they may have. Other popular programming languages like SQL and SAS should also be considered for a more comprehensive view of the landscape.\n",
