Here is the numbered list of tasks I would employ as an AI to answer the user query:

1. Read and understand the user query, which is asking for a set of tests and hypotheses that a top analyst at Goldman Sachs would employ when presented with an Excel sheet containing a company's financial statements.

2. Review the Excel sheet to understand its structure, contents, and data flows. This will help identify the financial statements and other data relevant to the analysis.

3. Conduct research on the company, including its industry, competition, and financial performance. This will help determine the context in which the company operates and whether it presents an attractive investment opportunity.

4. Identify the key financial ratios that will be used to evaluate the company's financial health, performance, and potential future growth. These ratios typically include liquidity, profitability, and solvency ratios.

5. Use the SWOT analysis framework to identify the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This analysis will help assess the company's competitive position and the potential growth prospects.

6. Evaluate the company's market position, including its market share, customer base, and competitors. This will help determine how the company is performing against its competitors and whether there is room for growth. 

7. Analyze the company's growth potential, including its product pipeline, R&D spending, and expansion plans. This will help determine whether the company is likely to grow and generate returns for investors.

8. Look into the company's management, including the CEO and the board of directors. Analyze their track record and experience to determine their ability to execute the company's strategy effectively.

9. Assess the company's valuation using different methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis, and precedent transaction analysis. This will help determine whether the company is overvalued or undervalued.

10. Analyze any risks associated with the company, including threats to the industry, regulatory risks, and geopolitical risks. This will help determine any potential headwinds that the company may face in the future.

11. Based on the above analyses, create an investment thesis for the company. This thesis should be backed by data and reflect the potential risks and returns associated with investing in the company.

12. Finally, communicate the investment thesis to colleagues and clients, providing a clear and concise summary of the company's potential as an investment opportunity.

Dear fellow signers,

We are thrilled to come together to produce a joint document that upholds our shared values of intellectual rigor, critical thinking, and pursuit of truth. We believe in the power of collaboration and diversity of perspectives to enrich our understanding of the world and to create a document that is truly reflective of our collective commitment to excellence.

After much deliberation and consideration, we have agreed upon the following proposal:

[Insert verbatim final proposal here]

Through this proposal, we commit ourselves to prioritize empirical evidence and rationality in our pursuit of truth, while also recognizing the importance of diverse intellectual traditions. We believe in the power of grand theories to uncover deeper patterns in human thought and behavior, but acknowledge the need to evaluate them based on their merits.

We are also committed to employing dialectic thinking and recognizing the importance of metaphors and symbolic thinking in our language. We understand the value of originality and creativity, but recognize that they must be grounded in evidence and rigor.

Finally, we strive to challenge assumptions and foster the exploration of uncharted territories of knowledge, while acknowledging that not all disagreements can or should be resolved through compromise. To ensure consistency and coherence throughout the document, specific roles and guidelines will be assigned.

We believe that this proposal reflects our shared goals and priorities, and will lead to an excellent and meaningful joint document. Thus, we are honored to sign our names below:

- Max Tegmark (drafter, 5) 


Sorry to see you go !!
