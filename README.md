# What it does
This is the attempt to try and make an agi analyst to help us out! It should be able to read documents, websites, extract info, create a task-list, prioritise it, check for compliance, update the lists, do google or wikipedia searches to figure out questions, and continuously iterate until you tell it to stop.

Beware - right now it's a strange loop!

# Additions to make
- Add more tools to the toolbelt
- Make the toolbelt work better
- Allow user choice to redirect the queries to the next step
- Edit the ability to load files, and an embed-index pair to update react file
- Add prompt:completions done into a doc

# The dream!
