# What it does
This is the attempt to try and make an agi analyst to help us out! It should be able to read documents, websites, extract info, create a task-list, prioritise it, check for compliance, update the lists, do google or wikipedia searches to figure out questions, and continuously iterate until you tell it to stop.

Beware - right now it's a strange loop!

# Additions to make
- Add a conversational agent to create and finalise the task list
- Add ability to load files, and an embed-index pair to update react file
- Add prompt:completions done into a csv
- Enable a callgpt update for the gpt3.5 calls, to systematise the whole thing
- Add a debate and summarise feature

# The dream!
