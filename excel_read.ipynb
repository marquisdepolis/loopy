      "1. Identify the top-selling product categories and types: We could group the data by 'Product Category' and 'Type' columns and calculate the total sales for each category and type to determine which ones are the most popular and profitable.\n",

      "2. Analyze the product tags: We could analyze the 'Tags' column to identify the most commonly used tags and their association with the sales of the products.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Analyze the pricing strategy: We could analyze columns such as 'Variant Price' and 'Variant Compare At Price' to determine the pricing strategy used for the products, identify any patterns in pricing, and evaluate the effectiveness of discount and sale strategies.\n",

      "5. Review the SEO information: We could analyze columns such as 'SEO Title' and 'SEO Description' to ensure that the product information is appropriate for the intended audience and to optimize the search engine rankings of the products.\n",

Then, I would count the number of rows that have a variant of jeans pieces in the 'Title' or 'Option1 Value' column, since the number of variants can vary based on the specific product. A pivot table could be used to easily count the number of unique variants for each product or variant option.\n",

      "2. Data cleaning and preprocessing: This would involve checking for missing or inconsistent data, handling any outliers or errors in the data, and preparing the data for analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Descriptive statistics: This would involve calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation for numeric columns in the DataFrame.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Correlation analysis: This would involve analyzing the correlation between different columns in the DataFrame to identify any relationships between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Time-series analysis: If the DataFrame contains time-series data, this would involve analyzing the trends and patterns in the data over time, such as seasonality or trends in sales or revenue.\n",
